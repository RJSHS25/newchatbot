AMB_01,"Why does my account show an insufficient monthly balance even though I have INR 5,000 in it?","To check if you are eligible for AMB or exempt from non-maintenance fees, please refer to the message sent by Federal Bank on 11 Nov 2024.

Average Monthly Balance (AMB) is calculated monthly from the onboarding date. For example, if you joined on July 1, 2024, and your average daily balance is INR 3,000 in your Pot account and INR 5,000 in your Savings account over 31 days, your AMB calculation would be:

(3,000 + 5,000) ÷ 30 = INR 267.
Since this exceeds the minimum required AMB of INR 5,000, no non-maintenance fee will be charged.

If you don’t have a Pot account, ensure your Savings account balance stays at or above INR 5,000 throughout the month. Alternatively, you can open an FD or a Super Pot account via Jupiter to maintain a closing balance of INR 20,000 by month-end.

If the AMB isn’t maintained, a fee of up to INR 200 + GST may be charged for every month of non-maintenance.
